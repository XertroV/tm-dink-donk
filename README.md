# Dink Donk -- Round Notifier

Will notify you when a new round is about to start and your game isn't focused (or if chat has focus).

Notifications include a sound alert and a visual indicator. The sound alert will (by default) only play if the game is unfocused. Otherwise only the visual indicator(s) will show up.

(Right now only one sound alert is available, but if anyone has suggestions I can add more options.)
